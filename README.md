# United Airlines Expert Mode Enhancement Script

## What Does It Do? 

This script, when coupled with expert mode on United's web site, will highlight fare buckets that are important to a UA frequent flier. 

## What Do I Need To Use This? 

You'll need Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or a similar browser extension that allows you to run javascript on pages.

## I fly with United and I need to see upgrade availability. What do I need to do? 

Well, first you'll need to be someone that has PlusPoints to use, or someone that will be the recipient of PlusPoints. Next, you'll need to be logged into a United account on their website and have Expert Mode enabled. You can enable Expert Mode on this page when logged in: https://www.united.com/en/us/account/preferences?accordion=0.
